# r_titanic_exercise

This module answers the questions posed by HarvardX's Machine Learning course
in the Titanic Exercises section (5.3).  It ultimately trains and employs a Random 
Forest machine learning model to make a prediction as to whether or not a passenger
would survive the sinking of the Titanic based on several variables.
